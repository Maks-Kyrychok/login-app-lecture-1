This project demonstrates an example of creating a splash screen in a mobile application. 

## There are several reasons why a splash screen can be useful in a mobile app:

User experience: A splash screen can improve the user experience by giving users feedback that the app is launching, so they don't feel like they're waiting for nothing. It also creates a smoother transition from the app's launch icon to the main screen.

App initialization: A splash screen can also be used to initialize the app's components and load resources in the background, which can enhance the app's behaviour and reduce the time it takes to load.

Platform conventions: On some platforms, such as iOS, splash screens are expected, and not having one can make the app feel unfinished or unprofessional. 

Also, there is a logging form with validation and the ability to memorize the user. When you re-login, if you previously checked the "remember me" box, the login and password data entered in the form fields will be saved on the device using the [Shared preference library](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences).
